Run the code, for main.py it is based on a lower amperage (I = 1.04 A), and graphs a radius^2 vs. Voltage. 
Main2.py uses a larger amperage (I = 2.03 A), and graphs a radius^2 vs. Voltage
The code for each python file calculates and prints the slope and the uncertainty/range for radius^2
I calculated the line of best fit with numpy.
To see Voltage vs. Radius^2 slopes and get correct e/m ratio, simply swap x and y in array.
